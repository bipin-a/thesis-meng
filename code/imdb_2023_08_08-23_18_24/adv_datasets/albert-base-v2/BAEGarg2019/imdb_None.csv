Pretty [[poor]]!","I have always liked Bill Murray in films like Lost in Translation, and the trailer for this film looked really good, but the result was very [[unfortunate]]. Basically Murray plays Jack Corcorin who has recently found out that his father died, and he is expected to hear his will. He finds out that his father was a clown, because he left a large shoe, his squeaky nose, and his main inheritance, an elephant! The only way that Jack can get rid of this elephant is to travel 4000 miles in four days and give him to a safe zoo for $30,000. Also starring Pat Hingle as Vernon. There are small tiny moments of humour, such as a truck's front bending forward, and Murray screaming, but overall, it's pointless.

The story about the men getting called back to duty during a short leave seems realistic enough, but there's no real pacing or tension in the story.

Many of the scenes in this film were flat and some of the actors were a bit weak. The story about the men getting called back to duty during a short leave seems realistic enough, but there's no real pacing or tension in the story. I also had a tough time understanding what the actors were saying, partially due to some strong English accents and perhaps some due to an inferior job of sound recording. I give this a 55/100.

"Northanger Abbey is not my favorite Jane Austen novel, but it has its charms. [[This]] movie doesn't.

Soul Plane [[sounds]] to be a ""black comedy"" spoof of a much well known movie, Airplane. This movie, is black comedy done at it's [[finest]]. Stereotypes can be funny, and a lot of times they are. [[and]] in this picture, it's disgusting. Okay, you have clubs, sex, drugs, everything crude that people associate with ""urban"" culture today.<br /><br />Tom Arnold's appearance in this movie, is this movie's saving grace if it ever had any. DL Hughley should have never accepted the script. Kevin Hart makes a [[terrific]] leading figure here... his appearance in this movie will probably grow annoying to many. Method Man and Snoop's appearance were by far, their [[greatest]].<br /><br />I am just happy that I didn't pay to see this movie...",0.005671441555023193,0.5001521110534668,0,1,0,225,"Successful"

"There are so many positive reviews on Return to Me that my opinion is not necessary to encourage you to watch this movie. However, I feel the need to express my admiration for this [[unique]] movie.

"I watched this expecting to see the usual British stiff upper lip stereotypes and was surprised to find the dialogue [[remarkably]] natural and tinged with black humour. It was more like Eastenders Goes to Sea than In Which We Serve. The scenes during the approach and attack are remarkably realistic in their depiction of a fighting ship and the stuff ups and banter among the ship's company (well at least based on my service in the 1970s). Some of the throwaway lines are very witty (""I'm not joining the Band of Hope just to please some greasy fish fryer!). My only [[complaint]] is that they didn't show what happened to the Irish coxswain and his bride to be, or the tattooed PO and his ""I Love Arabella"" tattoo!","I watched this expecting to see the usual British stiff upper lip stereotypes and was surprised to find the dialogue [[only]] natural and tinged with black humour.
