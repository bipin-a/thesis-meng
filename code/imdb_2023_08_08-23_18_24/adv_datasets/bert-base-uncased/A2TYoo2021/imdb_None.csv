[[Sadly]] it was botched in production and ended up on MST3K.","Parts: The Clonus Horror is not that [[negative]] of a movie. I have the MST3K version of it on tape and it is [[comic]], but its [[again]] not the [[hardest]] [[kino]] the have ever done. I would go so far as to say that it was better than 80% of the movies they have made fun of. The concept could have worked if they had a better script, more money and decent actors. It could have become a classic if it was not so [[tiresome]] and had a bit more excitement.

"I just watched it for the second time today and I must say with all my heart it is about damn time they made a movie about us as people not as spiritual beings. Such a waste of human [[life]] as this [[story]] was maybe some good will come out of it. And [[Eric]] is hotter than ever. To often in the movies First Nations people are seen as other than everyday people. We are always portrayed as chiefs or medicine people. Hey we are just like everyone else. And this movie [[showed]] just that. We hurt when an injustice is done and we can win in quest for justice. It is really to bad that the big movie companies cant see that. I cant wait till this comes out on DVD. Thanks to those who chose to show this story as it really was.","I just watched it for the second time today and I must say with all my heart it is about damn time they made a movie about us as people not as spiritual beings.

"A Roger Corman rip-off assembled for what appears to be [[virtually]] zero [[budget]]. All of the special [[effects]] were originally used in ""Battle Beyond the Stars"", and I [[suspect]] a fair amount of the props, costumes and sets were re-used from other sources as well. The story seems to have been written around these elements, so this isn't really a [[movie]] as much as it's a [[recycling]] [[project]].
