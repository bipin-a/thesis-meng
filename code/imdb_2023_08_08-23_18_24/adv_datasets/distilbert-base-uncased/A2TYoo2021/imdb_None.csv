"This seemed to be a lackluster film to me that betrays a low budget with poor cinematography and not all that great of a job of editing. It may be of interest to those who know something about submarines during the World War II era, but I recommend that all others beware. Many of the scenes in this film were flat and some of the actors were a bit weak. The story about the men getting called back to duty during a short leave seems realistic enough, but there's no real pacing or tension in the story. I also had a tough time understanding what the actors were saying, partially due to some strong English accents and perhaps some due to an inferior job of sound recording. I give this a 55/100.

Good hunting","this is more than a Sat. afternoon special. Exremely well written if very low [[indispensable]] there is a lot here if you look for it. Catch the cat companion/scout for instance. It not only could have been a comic book it should have been a comic book. The comic industry (as well as the film's publicists) [[flunked]] the boat on this. One of the [[lowest]] [[savoir]] really [[huge]] [[cinematography]]. A great script by John Sayles is a strong point but the acting is good as well. Probably the best ""super hero"" film I've ever seen. Short on special effects but long on believability. This one's a keeper. I have never seen a DVD of this film but i used to own a VHS version.

It seemed like that this film was for young children, but I know that adults will like this film. The storyline is pretty [[uncomplicated]]. A kid who moved to Florida must help a soccer jock and an outcast save burrowing owls from construction of a pancake house. The message in this film is big especially for animal activists and lovers. The message is about doing all you can to save endangered animals. The acting in this film is decent. All the three kids looked like they had good chemistry. The music is not too shabby. I liked Jimmy Buffet's songs in this film. Overall this is a [[alright]] family film. I rate this film a 9/10.",0.03135758638381958,0.7420225143432617,1,0,1,7,"Successful"
"This outlandish Troma movie is actually a very [[good]] movie. It is known as their epic and [[best]] and most highly rated production.
